## Features Description
| Feature            | Description                                                   | Potential Use Cases                                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **price**          | The selling price of the house (in local currency).            | Target variable for price prediction models.                   |
| **area**           | The total area of the house in square feet.                    | Feature for regression models, assessing property value.       |
| **bedrooms**       | Number of bedrooms in the house.                              | Indicator of house size; useful for classification models.     |
| **bathrooms**      | Number of bathrooms in the house.                             | Important feature in price prediction and clustering.          |
| **stories**        | Number of stories (floors) the house has.                      | Structural detail; useful in segmentation analysis.            |
| **mainroad**       | Indicates if the house is on the main road ("yes" or "no").   | Binary feature for accessibility analysis.                     |
| **guestroom**      | Availability of a guest room ("yes" or "no").                | Useful for understanding house amenities and value.            |
| **basement**       | Availability of a basement ("yes" or "no").                   | Influences property value and potential for renovations.       |
| **hotwaterheating**| Availability of hot water heating ("yes" or "no").            | Comfort feature; can be included in amenities scoring.         |
| **airconditioning**| Availability of air conditioning ("yes" or "no").             | Comfort feature; influences desirability in warmer climates.   |
| **parking**        | Number of parking spaces available.                           | Important for urban housing analysis and price estimation.     |
| **prefarea**       | Indicates if the house is in a preferred area ("yes" or "no").| Location-based feature; critical for real estate valuation.    |
| **furnishingstatus**| Furnishing status of the house ("furnished", "semi-furnished", or "unfurnished"). | Helps categorize properties for different market segments.    |

## Usage
This dataset is suitable for:
- Predictive modeling for housing prices.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Feature engineering and selection tasks.
- Machine learning projects focusing on real estate.

## How to Use
1. **Load the Dataset:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('Housing.csv')
   ```
2. **Data Exploration:**
   ```python
   df.head()
   df.describe()
   df.info()
   ```
3. **Preprocessing:**
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical (e.g., using one-hot encoding).
   - Handle any outliers or anomalies in the data.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Use regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
